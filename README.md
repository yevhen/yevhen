My name is **Yevhen** and I'm an author of several OSS projects. Most of them I did to simplify the things on my job and they are actively used in production. I try to keep the quality bar of my work high so you can enjoy the outcome.

If you're reaping the fruits of my work or simply like what I do and want to support my efforts, please consider making a donation:
