<p>Please consider helping Ukraine! The most effective thing you can do is donate to one of the local non-government charities that supply our defenders with critical equipment ‚Äî power stations, medical supplies, armored vests, light vehicles, reconnaissance drones, weapon attachments, etc. It's best to avoid donating to global funds, such as Red Cross or UN Crisis Relief, because they have a very limited presence in Ukraine and typically can't provide the most necessary support.

My name is **Yevhen** and I'm an author of several OSS projects. Most of them I did to simplify the things on my job and they are actively used in production. I try to keep the quality bar of my work high so you can enjoy the outcome.

If you're reaping the fruits of my work or simply like what I do and want to support my efforts, please consider making a donation:
